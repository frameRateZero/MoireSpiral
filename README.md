# MoireSpiral
A fork of @wblut's Processing Spiral draw sketch (https://github.com/wblut/Processing3Sketches/tree/master/spiral) to include controlP5 controls and the 5 spirals drawn as a single line.

This sketch has sliders to control the spiral offset, x, y direction to generate moire interference. 

It also has some image filters to control the look (e.g. posterize, blur, add 2D noise) of the spiralized image.
